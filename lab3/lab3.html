      <p>
        In this lab, I created a simple student bio webpage. It was my first chance to 
        practice structuring information about myself using HTML. I shared details about my 
        education, hobbies, and the languages I speak. This activity helped me see how web 
        pages can be used to organize personal information in a clear way.

        I learned how to structure a webpage to share personal information clearly.

        I experimented with colors, spacing, and fonts to improve readability. 
        This showed me how design choices affect the user experience.
