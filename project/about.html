      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

      <p>During this project, I learned how to build a full website from the beginning using only HTML and CSS. At first, it was challenging to understand how to structure each page and keep the layout consistent, but it became easier as I practiced with different tags and sections. I also learned how to organize files correctly, connect images, and make sure navigation worked on every page. Finishing each page step by step helped me stay on track, and I felt more confident as the website started to come together.</p>

      <p>Testing the site on different devices taught me how important responsive design is. On my laptop, the layout looked wide and spaced out, but on my phone the text and images needed to stack differently so the content was easier to read. I used a media query to adjust the layout for smaller screens, which helped improve readability.</p>

      <p>With the help of this project I got to know more about web development in a clear and practical way. I learned how to use HTML tags, CSS selectors, color palettes, navigation menus, tables, lists, and responsive design principles. I also learned the importance of accessibility, such as using alt text, headings, and readable contrast. This project helped me put everything together into one real website, and I now understand how each part of a webpage works and how to design a simple, professional layout.</p>
